**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have led to state-of-the-art results in many medical imaging tasks including Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, the network decisions are often perceived as being highly non-transparent making it difficult to apply these algorithms in clinical routine. In this study, we propose using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize convolutional neural network decisions for AD based on MRI data. Similarly to other visualization methods, LRP produces a heatmap in the input space indicating the importance of each voxel contributing to the final classification outcome. In contrast to susceptibility maps produced by guided backpropagation ("Which change in voxels would change the outcome most?"), the LRP method is able to directly highlight positive contributions to the network classification in the input space. Thus, the highlighted areas can be interpreted as the 'positive evidence' used by the network for deciding whether an individual has AD. We find that this LRP-evidence indeed fulfills those expectations that one would have towards AD evidence: (1) it is very specific for individuals ("Why does this person have AD?") with high inter-patient variability, (2) there is very little evidence for AD in healthy controls and (3) areas that exhibit a lot of evidence correlate well with what is known from literature. To quantify the latter, we compute size-corrected metrics of the summed evidence per brain area, e.g. the 'evidence density' or 'evidence gain'. Although these metrics produce very individual 'fingerprints' of relevance patterns for AD patients, a lot of importance is put on areas in the temporal lobe including hippocampus and amygdala. We conclude that LRP provides a powerful tool for assisting clinicians in finding evidence for AD (and potentially other diseases) in structural MRI data. 


## Quickstart

You can use the visualization methods in this repository on your own model (PyTorch; for a Keras implementation, see heatmapping.org) like this:

    model = Net()
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load("./mymodel"))
    # Convert to innvestigate model
    inn_model = InnvestigateModel(model, lrp_exponent=2,
                                  method="e-rule",
                                  beta=.5)
    model_prediction, heatmap = inn_model.innvestigate(in_tensor=data)
    
`heatmap` contains the relevance heatmap. The methods should work for 2D and 3D images alike, see the MNIST example notebook or the LRP and GB evaluation notebook for an example with MRI images.
    

## Code Structure

The repository consists of the general LRP wrapper (innvestigator.py and inverter_util.py), a simple example for applying the wrapper in the case of MNIST data, and the evaluation notebook for obtaining the heatmap results discussed in the article. 

## Trained Model and Heatmaps

The trained model has been made available by Johannes Rieke, see https://github.com/jrieke/cnn-interpretability. 
The methods for obtaining the heatmaps are shown in the notebook **Evaluate GB and LRP**

## Data

The MRI scans used for training are from the [Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). The data is free but you need to apply for access on http://adni.loni.usc.edu/. Once you have an account, go [here](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/) and log in. 



## Requirements

In order to run the code, standard pytorch packages and Python 3 are needed. 
Moreover, add a settings.py file to the repo, containing the data paths and so forth as follows:

```

settings = {
    "model_path": "/path/to/the/state/dict/model.sd",
    "data_path": "path/for/saving/results",
    "binary_brain_mask": "path/to/binary/brain/mask",
    "nmm_mask_path": "/path/to/labels_Neuromorphometrics.nii"
}

```
